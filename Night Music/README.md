### General:
Adds a new music folder (`nightmusic`, in the DDLC directory) in which you can put songs (`.mp3` or `.ogg`) that Monika can pick from to play in the evening (assuming there's no music playing already)

### Some Nitty Gritty:
NOTE: Music menu has a new button, and the `prev`/`next` page options are on the top of the menu. `Playlist Mode` only works for the `Nightmusic` option (second page) and if you click it while it's already active, it will have no effect. No way to fix that via overrides, so you'll have to select Nightmusic again.

### Extra Info:
EXTRA NOTE: If you're running MAS in unstable mode, change to the [unstable branch](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/blob/Unstable/Night%20Music/nightmusic.rpy) for this submod as there's been changes to some parts which are no longer compatible.
