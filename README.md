# Welcome to my submods repo

In here, you'll be able to find submods by looking through the [releases](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/releases) tab.


Installation is simple. For anything other than `Auto Weather Change`, simply extract it into a subfolder for submods inside your `game/` folder (for easy organization)

As for `Auto Weather Change`, just merge the `game/` folder from the submod with the `game/` folder in your `DDLC/` folder.
